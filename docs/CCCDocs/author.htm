				<span>Is designed to encapsulated common cross-cutting concerns (logging, exception handling, caching, etc.). 
						Often times cross-cutting concerns are an after-thought; or, hastily injected without any ability to manage or control.
						This project was to encapsulate those concerns and provide a mechanism to change/augment. Changing behaviour is a matter of inheritance and specifying choice via custom metadata.
