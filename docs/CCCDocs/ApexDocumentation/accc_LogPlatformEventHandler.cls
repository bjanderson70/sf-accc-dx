 * @description Handles Platform Events for Logging.
 *    This handler is associated with 'accc_ApexPublishEventLogger'. If this logger is
 *    wired into 'ApexRunEnvironmentSingleton', a trigger fires (after insert accc_Log__e).
 *    The trigger, 'accc_LogPlatformEventTrigger', fires and instantiates this class.
 *    The dispatcher calls 'run' and run invokes 'afterInsert'
